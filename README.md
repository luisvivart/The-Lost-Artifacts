# Full Online Store Projectwith React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project attempts to bring to life an online store of a personal brand of mine using technologies such as React, Redux, Firebase and the Stripe API.

As I have not yet uploaded the files onto a hosting service, the only way for you to visualize it would be via cloning this repository and starting your own react app, which, you are welcome to do since this is a public repo. That might or might not change in the future.
